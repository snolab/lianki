# Secrets and auth

## Secret hygiene

- secretlint runs pre-commit; gitleaks scans the **full history** in CI. Run it
  locally with `bun run scan:secrets`; config in `.gitleaks.toml`.
- `.env.local` and `.dev.vars` are gitignored and unrecoverable — never delete
  them. `.dev.vars` is auto-created from `.dev.vars.example` on the first
  `qa:all` run.

## Dev-only password auth

`auth.ts` enables email+password **only** when `NODE_ENV !== production` **and**
`DEV_EMAIL_PASSWORD_AUTH=1`, so it can never be on in the deployed app.
Production is passwordless: magic link + GitHub/Google.

## Google OAuth

Credentials (`AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`) are shared between
`fsrsnext.snomiao.com` and `lianki.com`. Both domains must be in the Google Cloud
Console OAuth client:

- `https://lianki.com/api/auth/callback/google` (canonical)
- `https://www.lianki.com/api/auth/callback/google` (keep registered — www still
  resolves and 308s to apex)

## Origins

The apex is canonical: `middleware.ts` 308s `www` → apex, and session cookies
bind to the exact hostname the user signed in on. The userscript rewrites an old
`www` `@downloadURL` to the apex so pre-2.23.18 installs keep working without a
reinstall.
